## Introduction
In high-throughput measurements, outliers are very common and the mean, SD and correlation are really  sensitive to them, so we cannot rely simply on these two statistics to make a robost summary of our data.

### The Median
One summary statistic that isn't as sensitive to outliers is the median. Which is the middle point of our data. It's the point that has half the data points
below it, half the points above it.

### The MAD: Median Absolute Deviation.
The MAD is a robust measure of the variability of a univariate sample of quantitative data. 
$$
 1.4826 \mbox{median} \lvert X_i - \mbox{median}(X_i) \rvert
$$

### Spearman correlation
Earlier we saw that the correlation is also sensitive to outliers.
Spearman correlation is a very simple idea.
Instead of looking at the values, we look at the ranks.
